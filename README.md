- Aluminum cans
- Glass bottles
- Tetra Pak
- Plastic bags, etc.

## 🚀 How It Works

- Trained on the [TACO Dataset](https://tacodataset.org/)
- Used Google Colab for training
- Deployed YOLOv5 (v7) with `best.pt` as final model

## 📁 Files

- `best.pt` – Trained YOLOv5 model
- `yolov5-object-detectio-using-TACO-dataset.ipynb` – Training + detection notebook
